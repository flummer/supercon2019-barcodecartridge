![Barcode Cartridge render](https://github.com/flummer/supercon2019-barcodecartridge/raw/master/IMAGES/front_back_render.png "Barcode Cartridge render")

This is designed to use the GM65 barcode reader module, that supports both 1D and 2D barcodes and is able to read from a screen (eg. a smartphone or the screen on the badge)

This cartridge is based on the [unofficial Superconference 2019 Badge Cartridge template](https://github.com/flummer/supercon2019-cartridgetemplate) and hence include the w25q128 SPI flash and a 100nF cap in addition to the 2x20 pin angled male pin header for the badge connection. The flash allows badge configurations and firmware specific to this cartridge to be loaded from the cartridge it self making it selfcontained.
